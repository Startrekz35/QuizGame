This Project is actually a challenge I gave to myself after reading through a reddit link at work (https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/tk21by/i_have_used_an_entire_day_writing_this_i_hate_how/)

Edit 7/5/22: Since the link is gone. I started this project with one if-else loop and built from there.

I thought to myself, maybe I could do better, and I just kept going from there

Testing what I'm learning with references and pointers and loops
Edit 7/9/22: And Functions

Update 4/24 Testing all of my knowledge

I ran into some confusing errors such as unqualified-id and redefinition errors

In the meantime I'll have to do some research, merge all the code previously split into one file again and polish my skills

Update 7/5 - 7/9
So here I return to this project, confused, but confident. I wanted to get further through the basics of C++ before returning to this.
I'm going to keep this project short (This is an unintentional lie). 
So I'm going to wrap up all the variables with a three question quiz
Limiting this quiz to 3 questions. Since I'm nearly finished learning the basics for C++, so let's see how I struggle to wrap this up
I've also learned that comments are SUPER IMPORTANT and functions are a LIFESAVER
