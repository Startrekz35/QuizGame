This Project is actually a challenge I gave to myself after reading through a reddit link at work (https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/tk21by/i_have_used_an_entire_day_writing_this_i_hate_how/)

Quiz Game

Description
The Quiz Game is a command-line C++ program that allows users to test their knowledge by answering a series of questions. The game provides direct and multiple-choice questions and checks the correctness of the user's answers, giving a final score at the end.

Features:
  Asks the user a mixture of direct and multiple-choice questions.
  Displays feedback after each question (correct or incorrect).
  Provides a final score at the end of the quiz.
  Simple, text-based interface.

Requirements

To run this project, you need:
  A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, Clang).
  A terminal or command-line interface.


How to Run the Program

Clone or download the repository to your local machine:
  git clone https://github.com/Startrekz35/QuizGame.git

Navigate to the project directory:
  cd QuizGame
  
Compile the C++ code using a compiler like g++:
  g++ -o quizgame main.cpp

Run the program:
    ./quizgame

How to Play:

The game will display a series of questions with a mixture of enter the answer and multiple-choice answers.
The program will tell you whether your answer is correct or not and proceed to the next question.
After answering all the questions, the program will display your total score.


Edit 7/5/22: Since the link is gone. I started this project with one if-else loop and built from there.

I thought to myself, maybe I could do better, and I just kept going from there

Testing what I'm learning with references and pointers and loops
Edit 7/9/22: And Functions

Update 4/24 Testing all of my knowledge

I ran into some confusing errors such as unqualified-id and redefinition errors

In the meantime I'll have to do some research, merge all the code previously split into one file again and polish my skills

Update 7/5 - 7/9
So here I return to this project, confused, but confident. I wanted to get further through the basics of C++ before returning to this.
I'm going to keep this project short (This is an unintentional lie). 
So I'm going to wrap up all the variables with a three question quiz
Limiting this quiz to 3 questions. Since I'm nearly finished learning the basics for C++, so let's see how I struggle to wrap this up
I've also learned that comments are SUPER IMPORTANT and functions are a LIFESAVER

Update 7/17
I'm still wrapping up this project and tweaking the variable and creating the conclusion
I had to add a variable to keep track of the bonus number of tries and had account for the pointer-to-address variable: reset

Update 7/18 (Release Date)
AT LONG LAST - This project is complete
3 Questions - Bonus Tries - Ready to Show off in my Tech Portfolio
