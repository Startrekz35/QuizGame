This Project is actually a challenge I gave to myself after reading through a reddit link at work (https://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/tk21by/i_have_used_an_entire_day_writing_this_i_hate_how/)

I thought to myself, maybe I could do better, and I just kept going from there

Testing what I'm learning with references and pointers and loops

Update 4/24 Testing all of my knowledge

I ran into some confusing errors such as unqualified-id and redefinition errors

In the meantime I'll have to do some research, merge all the code previously split into one file again and polish my skills
